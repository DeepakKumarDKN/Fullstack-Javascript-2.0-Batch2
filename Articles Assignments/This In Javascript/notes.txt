lets say i have created an empty file and i haven't written anything inside the file
but still javascript engine will create a gobal execution context and sets some memory space
even if it an an empty file.

Javascript engine also create somethng else known as window as well as this.
In the global label this points out to the window

this === window : true

window is a global object which is created along with the global execution context.
so whenever we run javascript program 3 things are created:
  1. Global Execution Context.
  2. Global object
  3. this

I case of browsers the Global Object is also known as window
Even though the file is empty the javascript will create this global Object.

Global Space:
-------------
var name = "deepak"
function display(){
  let username = "rahul"
}

here name is in the global spoace.
funcion display is in the global space
username is not in the global space because it is inside the function

so anything which is not inside the function is in the global space.

Whenever we will create any variable or fuctons in the global space we can access
it anywhere inside the program

These variables are function are get attatched into the global object which is known as window.

we can access it by writting ,
console.log(window.name)
console.log(this.name)
