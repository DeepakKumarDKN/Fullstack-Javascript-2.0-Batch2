undefined
---------
undefined is something which we will found only in javascript not in any other languages.
you guys must be wondering what is actually undefined is and where does it come from..

lets get into it. undefined is a very special word in javascript
we know that our javascript program execute in a very diffrent way 

as soon as the javascript code execute the global execution context is created 
and it is allocated memory to each variable and functions even before ou code execute ..

so now we are in the phase one and in the phase one the meory allocation happen at that time 
undefined will come into picture because in  phase one during memory allocation a special word known as undefined 
is being stored inside the variable ...

and it will remain stored inside it untill and unless we move into 2nd phase which is known as code execution phase
because in code execution phase only it will be replace with its original value ..

so this is how undefined come into picture ....

Javascript is a loosely typed language suppose if we hace declared something
var a = 20 but later on we can change the value of "a" then we can do it.

var a = true # here i am changing its datatype. this is what called loosely typed language

Languages like c and c++ they are strictly typed language if we are storing a string inside a variable 
then we cannot change it  it will only hold a string.

Not defined
-----------
not defined mean were accessing something which are not defined in our program that means 
var a = 10 

console.log(b)

here i have declared a but i havnt declared b .. so if i will acess b it will throw us an errror that 
ReferenceError: b is not defined
